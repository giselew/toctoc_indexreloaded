2017-01-25  Gisèle Wendl  <gisele.wendl@toctoc.ch>
	* Release of version 1.9.6 - This is a "github only" beta-version for Version 2.0.0
	* Added automated and fast CSS folding. 
	  Choose between "individual CSS-files per page" (fast) or "common (merged) CSS" (faster)
	* CSS folding and merge is done by webservice on toctoc.ch - it requires an API key (https://www.toctoc.ch/en/home/apikey/)
	* Define Classes, IDs and tags which should be left above the fold
	  These are normally elements which are added to the page by JavaScript onLoad in the browser
	* CSS above and below-the-fold may be frozen, no more call to the webservice are made when cssfolding.freezeFolding is active. 
	  Freeze is possible regardless if merged or not. Freezing merged CSS is safer, 
	  because the "element cloud" of the page does not change the name of the (merged) CSS files. 
	* Ext:toctoc_indexreloaded should work in any PHP-solution or other CMS 
	  (It does post-processing of the server reply without TYPO3), 
	  see file in folder Resources/Public/ExternalUse
	* When a querystring for original files is present, then the date information to form final file names is from the querystring - 
	  it avoids some unnecessary access to the filesystem
	* Last loaded JS-file may be loaded asynch with option process.asynchLastJS = 1
	* Added TypoScript-Setup and constants: 
	  As up to present version the extension configures in TYPO3 ext-manager,
	  if static template is added, then TS-Setup and Constants are valid 
	  (replacing configuration from ext manager)
	* Added option typo3tempsubfolder: Place for the JS and CSS-files
	* Non-TYPO3-Sites may use a configuration-file in folder Resources/Public/RawConfig
	* TBD: documentation is ... almost done :-)
	* TBD: Tests in many different environments 
	  Up now a bunch of tests have been made: 
	  Bootstrap package with manual mods, old Introduction Package, a site with manually made CSS, running TYPO3 4.7, a site using Twitter Bootstrap for a custom theme - 
	  TYPO3 extensions toctoc_comments, tt_news, news, indexed_search. Works fine.
